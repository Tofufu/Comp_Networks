Basic Socket Programming in C 

Simple program where a server (using TCP) listens/responds requests from client.

Meant for beginners to socket programming (hence the amount of comments).
Created with the help of a tutorial:  Socket Programming from Scratch!
Also a lot of the information is from pubs.opengroup.org and beej's guide to network programming!
